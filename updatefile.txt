        "Notes"     "Changes in 5.4.1"
        "Notes"     "- Updated stac_optimize_cvars to set certain new cvars (net_dc_reason and net_chan_limit_msec)"
        "Notes"     "net_chan_limit_msec is defaulted by StAC to 75, Valve defaults it to 50."
        "Notes"     "If you notice players getting kicked for exceeding processing time, feel free to raise this value, and StAC should respect it and leave it alone."
        "Notes"     "- Updated cvar check to check for host_timescale == 1, see https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Source-1-Games/issues/3911"
        "Notes"     "- Updated lots of cvar descriptions to be accurate, and consistent with each other in style"
        "Notes"     "- StAC now waits 30 seconds instead of 60 seconds to check client cvars when they first join the server. I probably should make this a cvar."
        "Notes"     "===== StAC is always looking for feedback! Got an issue, request, or wanna discuss? Open a GitHub issue and join the Discord server linked in the README, on GitHub! ====="
